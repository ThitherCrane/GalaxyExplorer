Congrats all for the great work!

I do not have a HoloLens so I will run Galaxy Explorer on my PC. I installed Unity and Visual Studio Community. However, I am unable to run the app. 
Do I need to download the GE to my PC as zip file and run it from VS or can I run it directly from GitHub?
I am sure many will ask similar questions. Please give step by step instructions.
Thanks!
